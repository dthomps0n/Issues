I'm happy to talk about how this could be set up in MailChimp. \r\n\r\nTo answer your direct question, yes there is the functionality within MailChimp to do this! \r\n\r\nI was thinking that each group could have their own list that contains the email addresses that are in that distribution list. You could have one standard email template that is saved within the \"Templates\" tab and then whenever a person in a specific group goes to create a campaign, they can select this template that is saved and can edit it to make it personalized to their group. They can then send out that campaign just to the list that is designated for their group. Each list is independent from the other so one email address can be in multiple lists and can be sent multiple campaigns from each list. \r\n\r\nThe other thing I was thinking that would be helpful is that we have different user levels. For example, an author user level can only create and edit campaigns but they can't send out campaigns. Here is our article that goes into the different user levels and how to add in users and change user levels: Manage User Levels in Your Account: http://eepurl.com/cEkjG9 \r\n\r\nI checked out the account and see that it's on the monthly plan.

In most cases score = 29 is valid for Client to be plased in group. Please read task description:\r\nbq. Change randomization to only randomize for those with scores >14 and *<29*\r\nbq. If a client has a signed ROI and consent form, but scored <15 or *above 29* completed Homeless Prevention Risk Tool, then display the score eligibility message.\r\nbq. Otherwise if a client has an ROI, consent form, and scored *15-28* on the risk tool, display their group assignment\r\n\r\nIt looks like \"above 29\" should be replaced with \"above 28\". Here can be the report issue because score = 29 was programmed as a valid score. Maybe that was the case? I've fixed the report. Could you please ask Customer to review?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nNatalie"}],"originalUpdated":"2018-06-26T01:41:31.918-0700","localAttachments":[{"title":"Link to issue","path":"https://clarityhs.atlassian.net/browse/RB-2749","type":"LINK","customIcon":"explore"}]}],"distractions":["Stuff and Things"],"globalLinks":[],"git":{"isShowIssuesFromGit":true,"isAutoImportToBacklog":true,"repo":"dthomps0n/Issues.git","prPrefix":"Check PR:"},"keys":{"globalShowHide":"Ctrl+Shift+X","goToDailyPlanner":"p","goToWorkView":"w","goToFocusMode":"F","goToDailyAgenda":"a","goToSettings":"","addNewTask":"*","showHelp":"?","openProjectNotes":"N","openDistractionPanel":"D","taskEditTitle":"e","taskToggleNotes":"n","taskOpenEstimationDialog":"t","taskToggleDone":"d","taskAddSubTask":"+","taskDelete":"Delete","taskOpenOriginalLink":"o","selectPreviousTask":"k","selectNextTask":"j","moveTaskUp":"Ctrl+Shift+ArrowUp","moveTaskDown":"Ctrl+Shift+ArrowDown","moveToBacklog":"B","moveToTodaysTasks":"T","expandSubTasks":"","collapseSubTasks":"","togglePlay":"y"},"config":{"googleDriveSync":{"isEnabled":true,"isAutoLogin":true,"isLoadRemoteDataOnStartup":true,"isAutoSyncToRemote":true,"isNotifyOnSync":false,"syncFileName":"SUPER_PRODUCTIVITY_SYNC.json","syncInterval":"PT5M"},"automaticBackups":{"isEnabled":false,"path":"~/backup-{date}.json","intervalInSeconds":6,"isSyncEnabled":false,"syncPath":"~/sync.json"},"pomodoro":{"isEnabled":false,"duration":"PT45M","breakDuration":"PT5M","longerBreakDuration":"PT15M","cyclesBeforeLongerBreak":4,"isStopTrackingOnBreak":true,"isStopTrackingOnLongBreak":true,"isShowDistractionsOnBreak":false,"isManualContinue":false,"isPlaySound":true,"isGoToWorkView":false},"isNotifyWhenTimeEstimateExceeded":true,"isBlockFinishDayUntilTimeTimeTracked":false,"isConfirmBeforeExit":true,"isShowTimeWorkedWithoutBreak":true,"isTakeABreakEnabled":false,"isAutoStartNextTask":false,"isEnableIdleTimeTracking":false,"minIdleTime":"PT5M","isShortSyntaxEnabled":false,"takeABreakMessage":"Take a break!

I think our other teams were planning to talk to you about this, so I just wanted to let you know that we are happy to have our content be shared if this is something you end up taking on.

I'm happy to talk about how this could be set up in MailChimp. \r\n\r\nTo answer your direct question, yes there is the functionality within MailChimp to do this! \r\n\r\nI was thinking that each group could have their own list that contains the email addresses that are in that distribution list. You could have one standard email template that is saved within the \"Templates\" tab and then whenever a person in a specific group goes to create a campaign, they can select this template that is saved and can edit it to make it personalized to their group. They can then send out that campaign just to the list that is designated for their group. Each list is independent from the other so one email address can be in multiple lists and can be sent multiple campaigns from each list. \r\n\r\nThe other thing I was thinking that would be helpful is that we have different user levels. For example, an author user level can only create and edit campaigns but they can't send out campaigns. Here is our article that goes into the different user levels and how to add in users and change user levels: Manage User Levels in Your Account: http://eepurl.com/cEkjG9 \r\n\r\nI checked out the account and see that it's on the monthly plan. This includes unlimited sending so you can send however many campaigns you would like. The billing is based on the total subscriber count across all lists so for example if there was 1000 subscribers in one list and then 1000 subscribers in another list, that would come to a total of 2000 subscribers for the entire account. \r\n\r\nCertainly if you have any other questions around this or run into any issues, please feel free to reach out through this email and I'd be happy to help in any way that I can.

In most cases score = 29 is valid for Client to be plased in group. Please read task description:\r\nbq. Change randomization to only randomize for those with scores >14 and *<29*\r\nbq. If a client has a signed ROI and consent form, but scored <15 or *above 29* completed Homeless Prevention Risk Tool, then display the score eligibility message.\r\nbq. Otherwise if a client has an ROI, consent form, and scored *15-28* on the risk tool, display their group assignment\r\n\r\nIt looks like \"above 29\" should be replaced with \"above 28\". Here can be the report issue because score = 29 was programmed as a valid score. Maybe that was the case? I've fixed the report. Could you please ask Customer to review?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nNatalie"}],"originalUpdated":"2018-06-26T01:41:31.918-0700","localAttachments":[{"title":"Link to issue","path":"https://clarityhs.atlassian.net/browse/RB-2749","type":"LINK","customIcon":"explore"}]}],"doneBacklogTasks":[],"distractions":[],"globalLinks":[],"git":{"isShowIssuesFromGit":false,"isAutoImportToBacklog":false,"repo":"","prPrefix":"Check PR: "},"uiHelper":{"isShowWelcomeDialog":false,"isShowBookmarkBar":false,"dailyTaskExportSettings":{"separateBy":", ","separateFieldsBy":"","isUseNewLine":false,"isListSubTasks":true,"isListDoneOnly":false,"isWorkedOnTodayOnly":true,"showTitle":true,"showTime":false,"showDate":false},"timeSheetExportSettings":{"isAutoLogin":false,"isAutoFocusEmpty":false,"defaultValues":["AASDAS"]},"timeTrackingHistoryExportSettings":{"separateBy":"","separateFieldsBy":";","isUseNewLine":true,"isListSubTasks":true,"isListDoneOnly":false,"isWorkedOnTodayOnly":true,"showTitle":true,"showTimeSpent":true,"isTimeSpentAsMilliseconds":true,"showDate":true},"csvExportSettings":{"separateBy":"","separateFieldsBy":";","isUseNewLine":true,"isListSubTasks":true,"isListDoneOnly":false,"isWorkedOnTodayOnly":true,"showTitle":true,"showTimeSpent":true,"isTimeSpentAsMilliseconds":true,"showDate":false},"dailyAgenda":{"showSubTasks":true}},"jiraSettings":{"isJiraEnabled":true,"isFirstLogin":true,"isWorklogEnabled":true,"isAutoWorklog":false,"isCheckToReAssignTicketOnTaskStart":true,"isUpdateIssueFromLocal":true,"isAddWorklogOnSubTaskDone":true,"jqlQuery":"assignee = dougt AND status != 'closed' AND status != 'resolved' AND status != 'Done' AND status !='Closed' ORDER BY createdDate ASC","isEnabledAutoAdd":true,"jqlQueryAutoAdd":"assignee = dougt AND status != 'closed' AND status != 'resolved' AND status != 'Done' AND status !='Closed'","userName":"dougt@bitfocus.com","userAssigneeName":"dougt","password":"Fs3YfIbmtpjrDaRrcg0EBADF","host":"https://clarityhs.atlassian.net","isTransitionIssuesEnabled":true,"transitions":{"OPEN":"ALWAYS_ASK","IN_PROGRESS":"ALWAYS_ASK","DONE":"ALWAYS_ASK"}}}}],"doneBacklogTasks":[]}
